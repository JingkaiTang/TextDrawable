###TextDrawable 

Fork of the TextDrawable library originally found [here](https://github.com/amulyakhare/TextDrawable).
It has been reworked to be more simplified as well as had several features added including settings an icon and generating a Bitmap object. For example of how to use the newly structured API, see the [Builder Class](https://github.com/Kennyc1012/TextDrawable/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/amulyakhare/textdrawable/TextDrawable.java#L204) or look at the [sample](https://github.com/Kennyc1012/TextDrawable/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/kennyc/sample/MainActivity.java) for examples.
